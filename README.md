## UAT "Designing Website Interfaces" Class Repository

### Projects:

- Practice Website
  - Objective was to create a very basic website in HTML, CSS, and JS, to review and practice concepts taught in previous class (Beginning Website Interfaces).
- Slideshow
  - Objective was to create a simple slideshow in HTML, CSS, and JS, using primarily JS for functionality and handling image data via an Array Data Structure.
- Checkers Game
  - Objective was to create a simple Checkers game in HTML, CSS, and JS. The only requirement was styling and ensuring the user can move pieces on the board one square at a time. I added more functionality than was required, but could not finish the game due to a very short deadline.
